      <description>The expansion of modern communication is creating enormous opportunities to gather survey data remotely. To explore this opportunity, we work with two NGOs in three provinces of rural Pakistan in testing two remote survey modalities&amp;mdash; telephonic interviews via enumerators and interactive voice recording. Our results show that interviews led by enumerators largely outperform robocalls in survey quality. In a panel survey with 12,017 beneficiaries, robocalls had lower call pick-up (by 57%), consent (by 92%), and interview completion rates (by 91%). Mistrust in automatized calls, respondent unavailability and low technical skills were self-reported challenges for robocall recipients. Additionally, testing robocall framing, we find evidence of bias towards female voice recordings in acquiring consent. Medical and religious contextualization also improve outcomes such as overall item response. Robocalls are also less cost-effective in our sample, where a completed interview using IVR is approximately 88 times as expensive as one conducted via an enumerator.</description>
