      <title>The Power of Faith: Effects of an Imam-led Information Campaign on Labor Supply and Social Interactions</title>

      <description>We conduct a field experiment randomizing a remote awareness campaign that promotes social distancing and preventive health behavior to contain disease spread in rural Pakistan. We examine the impact caused by religious leaders’ endorsements of the campaign on labor supply and social interaction patterns. Our results show that the campaign led to reductions in labor supply and social interactions only when accompanied by Imams’ public endorsements. The effects are driven by male individuals, who adjust behavior in response to greater concerns about the risk of transmitting a disease to others. Despite increases in knowledge, we observe no effects on behavior among female individuals. These findings are compatible with predictions from a model that analyzes an individual trade-off between prevention benefits from social distancing and losses from forgone labor income, and points out the importance of information credibility for individual decision-making in times of uncertainty. Our results highlight the informational role of religious leaders in shaping critical beliefs and behavior in the context of a health crisis. [&lt;em&gt;Draft coming soon.&lt;/em&gt;]</description>

      <title>Easy, Informative, and Cheap? On the Effectiveness of Interactive Voice Response Calls</title>

      <description>The expansion of modern communication is creating enormous opportunities to gather survey data remotely. In collaboration with two NGOs across three provinces in rural Pakistan, we assess the efficiency of telephonic interviews conducted by enumerators versus interactive voice recording (IVR, or robocalls). Our results show that interviews led by enumerators largely outperform robocalls in survey quality. In a panel survey with 12,017 NGO beneficiaries, robocalls had lower call pick-up (by 57%), consent (by 92%), and interview completion rates (by 91%). Mistrust in automatized calls, respondent unavailability, and not wanting to lose phone credit were self-reported reasons to drop IVR calls. Testing robocall framing, we find that female voice recordings can partly mitigate low IVR consent rates. Similarly, medical and religious contextualization improve outcomes such as overall item response. However, with 88 times the price of a completed enumerator-led interview, robocalls are substantially less cost-effective in our setting.</description>
